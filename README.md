# FAQ

### Does this plugin depend on any others?

Yes. Please install the WP Term Meta plugin.

### Does this create new database tables?

No. There are no new database tables with this plugin.

### Does this modify existing database tables?

No. All of WordPress's core database tables remain untouched.

### Can I query for terms by their `visibility`?

Yes. Use a `meta_query` like:

```
$terms = get_terms( 'category', array(
	'depth'      => 1,
	'number'     => 100,
	'parent'     => 0,
	'hide_empty' => false,

	// Query by visibility using the "wp-term-meta" plugin!
	'meta_query' => array( array(
		'key'   => 'visibility',
		'value' => 'private'
	) )
) );
```
